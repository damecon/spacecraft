Since our program is a game that is made on the Unity engine, our code is divided up into scripts to make sure game objects perform the right functions.
Each scripts function within the system is what its name implies; MoveScript.cs is code used to move game objects,
MenuScript.cs is code for a functioning menu, firing script is code used for the action of shooting a weapon,
so on and so forth. While it may be hard to see the bigger picture at first, with the way the code is orgranized
when it's all put together, it becomes a functioning program, such is the nature of game programming.
